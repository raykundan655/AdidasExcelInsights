3. *Monthly Operating Profit by Retailer*  
   Track monthly profit patterns across various retailers to identify seasonal effects or top performers.

4. *Units Sold by Product*  
   Understand which product types or categories contribute most to the total units sold.

5. *Top 20 States by Units Sold*  
   Highlight the geographic regions with the highest product movement based on units sold.

6. *Average Sales by Retailer*  
   Compare average revenue figures among retailers to identify consistent performers.

7. *Yearly Total Sales by Region*
